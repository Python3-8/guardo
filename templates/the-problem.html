  <p>&emsp;Global warming. Global warming, in simple terms, is the long-term increase in the Earth's average temperature
    due
    to the buildup of certain gases in the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide from human activities like burning
    fossil fuels.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>&emsp;For example, the majority of the electricity that we all use comes from power stations, which mostly burn
    fossil fuels. Fossil fuels release carbon dioxide when burnt, which is a greenhouse gas. This is only one of the
    many gases that human activities produce, which lead to global warming.</p>
  <p>&emsp;Global warming is one of the biggest problems of today's world. Global warming leads to climate change,
    which in turn has been increasing the risk of natural hazards all around the world. Global warming also induces
    rising sea levels, which could engulf low-lying island territories in the future. These are just a fraction of the
    problems caused by global warming.</p>
  <p>&emsp;
    <q>With increasing global surface temperatures the possibility of more droughts and increased intensity of storms
      will
      likely occur. As more water vapor is evaporated into the atmosphere it becomes fuel for more powerful storms to
      develop. More heat in the atmosphere and warmer ocean surface temperatures can lead to increased wind speeds in
      tropical storms. Rising sea levels expose higher locations not usually subjected to the power of the sea and to
      the
      erosive forces of waves and currents.</q> â€” <a

  <h3 class="subheading">Solutions</h3>
  <p>&emsp;As can be seen in the pictures above, global warming poses a serious threat to global safety. Therefore, we,
    the
    members of team VWS Guardos have proposed solutions to aid in reducing global warming.</p>
